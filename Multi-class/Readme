A novel over-sampling technique, called MDO (Mahalanobis Distance-based Over-sampling technique), is proposed to improve the learning 
ability of multi-class imbalanced data sets. In other words, the synthetic samples are generated in such a way that they almost preserve
the same characteristics as the original minority class examples. In the next step, a new hybrid sampling/Boosting approach is proposed. 
MDOBoost combines both MDO over-sampling technique and AdaBoost.M2 algorithm; which significantly outperform both over-sampling and class decomposition schemes in MAUC, G-mean, and minority class recall.

The code for MDO over-sampling technique is also uploaded.
